    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the flour, salt, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Add the ½ cup cubed butter and combine using your hands. Combine until
        it resembles coarse meal, but make sure to leave some big chunks of
        butter in there.
      </li>
      <li>Add the vinegar and mix in.</li>
      <li>
        Slowly add the water to the mixture. You might not need all of it. If
        the dough is too dry, feel free to add one tablespoon of extra water at
        a time. Combine the mixture and do not over work it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generously flour the counter and the rolling pin. Place the dough on the
        counter and knead until the ball is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Roll the dough out into a long rectangle.</li>
      <li>
        Add half of the frozen, grated butter to the bottom two thirds of the
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold the top third of the dough towards you. Next, fold the bottom third
        to the middle.
      </li>
      <li>Turn the folded dough 90° and roll out into a rectangle.</li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining frozen, grated butter to the bottom two thirds of the
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold the top third of the dough towards you. Next, fold the bottom third
        to the middle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wrap the folded dough in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator
        for one hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425°F. Take the puff pastry dough out of the
        refrigerator and place on the floured countertop. Roll the pastry out
        into an 18-inch square.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush off any excess flour from the dough. Carefully and tightly roll
        the dough up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the dough into 12 equal portions. Place each of the dough piece into
        a muffin tray, cut side up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press down on and flatten the dough into the muffin tray. Place the
        muffin tray in the refrigerator while you make the filling.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the egg yolks, cornstarch, and one fourth cup of milk in a bowl
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the remaining milk, heavy cream, sugar, salt, vanilla
        bean, cinnamon stick, and lemon zest in a saucepan over medium-high
        heat. Bring to a simmer and reduce the heat. Simmer for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cinnamon stick and vanilla bean. Make sure to scrape any of
        the vanilla seeds out of the bean and into the saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop out a ½ cup of the heated mixture and place it in the bowl with
        the egg yolks. Whisk the contents in the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add another ½ cup of hot milk to it while still whisking. Slowly add the
        mixture into the saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk until the filling just begins to thicken. Remove from the heat and
        add the butter and vanilla extract. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the muffin tin out and fill each tin with a portion of the filling.
        Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave
        the egg tarts in for an extra 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with powdered sugar and ground cinnamon to top.</li>
